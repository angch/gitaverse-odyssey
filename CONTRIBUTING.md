# Contributing to Gitaverse Odyssey

We're excited for you to join us in building this vast, collaborative narrative! Here are the rules to keep in mind:

## Rules:

1. **Contributing**: Each commit should add one sentence to the story. Sentences should build on the story in a coherent and meaningful way. Contributions that don't align with this will not be merged.

2. **Main Branch**: The main branch is the 'prime' universe, pull requests are used to propose the merging of a branch back into the main storyline. The community will discuss and vote on these, and if accepted, the new sequence of events will become the canon in the main story.

3. **Create Your Universe**: If you want to create a parallel universe or a different storyline within our Gitaverse, you should create a new branch. The title of the branch should briefly reflect the theme or major difference of this parallel universe.

4. **No Explicit Content**: Please avoid explicit, adult, or offensive content. The goal is to make the game fun and enjoyable for all participants.

5. **Respect and Inclusivity**: All contributors should respect each other's ideas and narratives. Discrimination, harassment, or any form of disrespect is not tolerated. This is an inclusive environment and all contributions should reflect that.

6. **Writing Quality**: While we encourage participation from everyone, try to maintain a decent quality of writing. This includes proper grammar, punctuation, and spelling. We understand that everyone has different levels of writing proficiency, so help each other out if possible.

7. **No Spamming**: Committing the same sentence multiple times, unnecessary sentences, or gibberish sentences is not allowed.

8. **Game Continuity**: Every commit should make sense in the context of the story so far. Random, off-topic sentences might be removed. Commit messages should be clear, concise, and relevant to the sentence being added. This helps in understanding the context of the sentence and aids in maintaining the narrative flow.

9. **Collaborate, Discuss, and Report**: Use the discussion tab and comments on commits for real-time collaboration on story ideas, plot twists, character development, and other game elements. Use GitHub issues to report any inconsistencies in the story, propose larger shifts in direction, or discuss overarching themes and arcs.

10. **Character Limit**: To keep things balanced, a limit of 300 characters is set for each sentence committed.

By following these rules, we aim to create an ever-evolving story that's shaped by a community of contributors. Remember, the primary goal of this project is to have fun and create an interesting, engaging shared narrative. Happy writing and enjoy your time in the Gitaverse!
