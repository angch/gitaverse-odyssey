# Infinite Universes: A Gitaverse Odyssey

## About
Infinite Universes is an open-source, text-based game inviting everyone to contribute to an ever-evolving story. Each commit adds a sentence to the narrative, and branches represent parallel universes of the story. Together, we're creating a vast, collaborative multiverse of stories â€“ a gitaverse.

## The Story Begins...
"In the year 2095, on the neon-lit streets of New Neo City, a mysterious figure named Zero received an encrypted message that would change the course of the universe forever."

For more information on how to contribute to the story, check out the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
